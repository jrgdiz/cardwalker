Cardwalker
==========

This is a utility for processing _Magic: the GatheringÂ®_ card text.

The script will parse the oracle text in `oracle/` and create an abstract representation of abilities, that can be accurately searched. Furthermore, it will be possible to simulate a basic state game and keep track of triggered events and SBE when cards are played.
