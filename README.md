Cardwalker
==========

This is a utility for processing _Magic: the GatheringÂ®_ card text.

The script parses oracle text and creates an schematic XML representation of a card's abilities and characteristics.

It is quite a work in progress but as we all know trying to grammarize natural language is no easy task. As a benchmark, right now it can represent 99 out of 234 cards in Magic 2013 (42%), which I think is good progress.
