Funny thing: "Tormented soul can't block and is unblockable" is parsed in two ways. Before, it assumed "Tormented soul can't block and" was the cardname. Now that we added "can't block" as property, it correctly recognizes "Tormented Soul" as the cardname. Even though we told him to stop at a property, "can't block" wasn't before, so it was oblivious to it. And it correctly parsed -- adding "can't block" didn't increase the card count. So it's not a firesure way of knowing they are parsing correctly if they are parsed -- beware!
